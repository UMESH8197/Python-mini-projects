# Price Elasticity of Demand using Python
# it means the degree to which the demand for a product changes with an increase or decrease in its price. 
# For example, the demand for a product increases by 20% due to a 10% decrease in its price. 
# This is what it means to change in demand with the change in the price of a product. And 
# when you calculate the degree to which demand changes, itâ€™s called the price elasticity of demand. 

# To calculate the price elasticity of demand, you have to use the formula mentioned below:

# Percentage Change in Quantity Demanded / Percentage Change in the Price
